# Harmonic-patterns-finder
This is a simple python app that I created, to help me in my trading. When I chart and look for harmonics it is a pain to always look for the ratios of the harmonics I think I found, so I written this app to help me identify the pattern (if there is one that exist with ma ratios)
The app works in this way:
Input the values of the 'xb', 'ac', 'bd' and 'xd of the ratios you think can match a harmonic pattern and the app will check in the excel file "harmonics.xlsx" with predifined values of a harmonic patterns to find a match from your values and print the result if it found a harmonic or more than one (as it is possible your values to match more than one harmonic pattern)
